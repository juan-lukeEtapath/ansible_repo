# Ansible Project for Environment Setup

This Ansible project is designed to automate the setup of development environments on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux (Ubuntu and Arch), and MacOS. It follows industry standards and best practices for DevOps.

## Prerequisites

Before using this Ansible project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your target machines:

- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Usage

To use this Ansible project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
```

2. Create an Ansible inventory file (inventory.yml) with your target hosts. You can use the provided sample inventory files in the inventory directory as a reference.

3. Review and modify the variables in the group_vars and host_vars directories as needed for your specific setup.

4. Run the Ansible playbook for the desired environment setup. For example, to set up a development environment on Ubuntu, run:

```bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ubuntu.yml
```

*Replace ubuntu.yml with the appropriate playbook for your target OS.

5. The playbook will automate the installation and configuration of various components, including Ruby, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Android Studio, and development tools.

Once the playbook completes, your development environment will be ready for use.
